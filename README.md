## Description

This project develops and evaluates ensemble machine learning models to classify individuals into seven obesity categories based on lifestyle and physical condition characteristics. The study focuses on populations from Latin American countries (Mexico, Peru, and Colombia) and compares the performance of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks using homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble techniques.

## Key Results

- **Best Overall Performance:** C5.0 Boosted Decision Tree (98.58% accuracy, 0.9858 macro F1)
- **Most Robust Model:** Logistic Regression Homogeneous Ensemble with 10-fold CV (96.69% accuracy, 0.9669 macro F1)
- **Dataset:** 2,111 observations across 7 obesity categories with 18 features
- **Top Predictors:** BMI, weight, age, and family history of overweight
- **Validation:** Cross-validated results demonstrate strong generalization capability

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* R (>= 4.0.0)
* RStudio (recommended)
* Required R packages: caret, caretEnsemble, nnet, rpart, rpart.plot, C50, VGAM, glmnet, dplyr, ggplot2

### Installing

* Clone or download this repository
* All required packages installation code is included in the document
* Dataset is automatically downloaded from UCI ML Repository during execution

### Executing Program

* Open `obesity_prediction_ensemble.Rmd` in RStudio
* Run all code chunks sequentially or knit to HTML
* Results and visualizations will be generated inline
* Expected runtime: ~15-20 minutes depending on system performance
* Progress messages displayed for major sections

## Models Implemented

1. **Multinomial Logistic Regression** (with LASSO feature selection)
2. **Decision Trees** (rpart and C5.0 with boosting)
3. **Neural Networks** (nnet with hyperparameter tuning)
4. **Homogeneous Ensembles** (bagging for each model type)
5. **Heterogeneous Ensemble** (majority voting)
6. **Stacked Ensemble** (meta-learner approach)

## Performance Comparison

| Model Type | Accuracy | Macro F1-Score |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression Ensemble (CV) | 96.69% | 0.9669 |
| C5.0 Boosted Decision Tree | 98.58% | 0.9858 |
| Neural Network Ensemble | 96.38% | 0.9637 |
| Stacked Heterogeneous Ensemble | 95.20% | 0.9520 |

## Repository Contents

* `obesity_prediction_ensemble.Rmd` - R Markdown source code for complete analysis
* `Obesity_Prediction_Ensemble.html` - Rendered HTML report (download from [Releases](https://github.com/npp98/machine-learning-biological-data/releases/latest))

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Feature engineering (BMI calculation), encoding, normalization
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Distribution analysis and feature relationships
3. **Individual Models**: Baseline performance of logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks
4. **Homogeneous Ensembles**: Bagging techniques for each model type
5. **Heterogeneous Ensembles**: Majority voting and stacked meta-learner approaches
6. **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, confusion matrices, and performance metrics
7. **Feature Importance**: Analysis of key predictors across models
